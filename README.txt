Recoding I did of a Practical Computing for Scientsts group project I had.
Changes:
*Incorporated relativistic momentum into pion decay length math, tacked on v vs. p plot to boot.
*Adjusted hisotgram weights for the second half of "Systematic Uncertainties," so as to reflect a bin miscount as opposed to a bin mismeasure.
*Created section headers
*Wrote all new explanations
*Retitled, enhanced, and cleaned up all plots
*Eliminated reused code
*Corrected Units
